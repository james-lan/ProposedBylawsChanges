## Proposal 1 (Fiscal Year change)
### Article VI: Section 2:
> The fiscal year of the corporation commences on the first day of November and ends on the last day of October.

***to***
> The fiscal year of the corporation commences on the first day of ***January*** ~~November~~ and ends on the last day of ***December*** ~~October~~.

#### Summary
* Changes fiscal year from November-October to January-December in the bylaws.
* This MUST be changed to another time, as our bylaws and filings do not match up. 
* This will cause us a short year return to be generated, which will cost some to prepare. 

#### Rights changes
* This changes no rights of the members or board. 

##Proposal 2 (Special Meetings change)
### Article III: Section 3:
> A petition presented to all voting members and approved by one half (1/2) of voting members may call a special meeting. Such a petition must include the date, time, place and agenda of the special meeting. Notification of the result of the petition shall be presented to all members prior to the meeting.

***to***
> A ***special meeting may be called by a*** petition presented to all voting members and approved by one ***fourth (1/4)*** ~~half (1/2)~~ of voting members may call a special meeting***, or via unanimous decision of the board of directors.*** ~~such~~ ***A*** petition ***or special meeting called by the unanimous decision of the board*** must include the date, time, place***,*** and agenda of the special meeting. Notification of the result of the petition shall be presented to all members prior to the meeting.

#### Summary 
* Added wording to specify what the petition would pertain to, allowing the addition of the boards power to call a special meeting with a unanimous decision.
* Changed the call from 1/2 (currently almost 350 members/175 needed, to 1/4 (about 85), which seems to be much more manageable with our current size.
* Added the ability for the board of directors to call a special meeting with a unanimous vote (100%) and wording to support this ability.

#### Rights change
* This adds the right for the board to unanimously call for a special meeting
* This reduces the percentage of membership required to call a special meeting. For the meeting to have any votes, a quorum of 25% must still be maintained. (Article 3, Section 4)

## Proposal 3 (Election wording clarification and fix)
### Article V: Section 3:
> Each member present shall be given an opportunity to be a candidate for each officer position and each at-large director position on the board. If there is more than one candidate for an officer position, the candidate which obtains the highest number votes from voting members present shall be elected. In the event of a tie, the election is decided by coin flip. If there are no candidates for an officer position, the outgoing officeholder may, if eligible, elect to serve another term. If more than two members are candidates for at-large director, each voting member present shall rank the candidates. The two candidates obtaining the highest preferences from voting members present shall be elected. In the case of a vacancy on the board, the remainder of the board has the right to appoint an interim member or to hold a special election to elect an interim member to fill the position for the remainder of the term.

***to***
> Each member present shall be given an opportunity to be a candidate for ***an elected position on the board.*** ~~each officer position and each at-large director position on the board.~~ If there is more than one candidate for an officer position, the candidate which obtains the highest number votes from voting members present shall be elected. In the event of a tie, the election is decided by coin flip. If there are no candidates for an officer position, the outgoing officeholder may, if eligible, elect to serve another term. If more than ***four*** ~~two~~ members are candidates for at-large director, each voting member present shall rank the candidates. The ***four*** ~~two~~ candidates obtaining the highest preferences from voting members present shall be elected. In the case of a vacancy on the board, the remainder of the board has the right to appoint an interim member or to hold a special election to elect an interim member to fill the position for the remainder of the term.

#### Summary
* This is housekeeping, and should have been done last year. 
* Specified that it must be a ***voting*** member (?) 
* Changed from specifying officers and at-large directors, to just an elected position which encompasses the whole of the board.
* Changed two instances of "two" to "four" since their are now four at-large members per last years board change.

#### Rights
* This does not cause any changes in the rights, it's just a thing that was missed with the bylaw changes last year not including this section. 

## Proposal 4 (Annual meeting changes)
### Article III: Section 2: Sentence 3:
> At the annual meeting, the voting members shall elect the Board of Directors, review and vote on the standing rules and policies of the corporation, receive reports on the activities of the corporation, approve the budget and determine the direction of the corporation in the coming year.

***to***
> At the annual meeting, the voting members shall elect the Board of Directors, review and vote on the standing rules and policies of the corporation, receive reports on the activities of the corporation, ***and voice their opinion in*** ~~approve the budget and determine~~ the direction of the corporation in the coming year.

#### Summary
* Removes approving the budget as their are other ways to express a members opinion at board meetings and budget meetings.
* States that the membership is required time to voice their own opinion about what the board can do to improve or change for the rest of the election year.

#### Rights 
* This takes away the right of the membership to direct MakeICT. 
* This takes away the membership right of budget control, and puts it in the hands of the board.
* The board gains sole control of the budget. 

## Proposal 5 (Fix to wording and codification of time for annual report)
### Article IV: Section 6:
> The Officers must provide an annual report. The report shall chronicle the activities of the corporation, including specific narratives on the corporation's work, the corporation's annual financial statements, relevant legal filings, and relevant copies of the organization's district and federal tax returns.

***to***
> The Officers must provide an annual report ***at the annual meeting***. The report shall chronicle the activities of the corporation, including specific narratives on the corporation's work, the corporation's annual financial statements, relevant legal filings, and relevant copies of the organization's ***state*** and federal tax returns. 

#### Summary
* Specifying that the annual report must be a the annual meeting prevents the board from keeping information from the membership.
* Changing district to state as their is no district tax return. This is an artifact that hadn't been caught in the past. 

#### Rights
* No rights are changed.
* Duty of the officers to provide an annual report is clarified to be at the annual meeting (as it has been done in the past.)

* Removed the list leading ',' with a colon.

### Article IV: Section 4:

* Adds another officer to the board.









### Still on the to-do list:
* Other members of the board to provide input
